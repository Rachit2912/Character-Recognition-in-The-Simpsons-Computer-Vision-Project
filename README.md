# Character-Recognition-in-The-Simpsons-Computer-Vision-Project
Developed a computer vision system to identify characters from The Simpsons using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. We used [The Simpsons Character Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset) present at Kaggle to train & test this model. It involves Data Collection &amp; Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Model Training, Evaluation &amp; Optimization &amp; Deployment.
